### The Cell/B.E. System Simulator

IBM's Cell CPU Full System Simulator is basically a super debugger for Cell applications. It creates a software-defined Cell processor on which it can boot and run a "virtual" Linux system (Fedora 9 by default). This software does install on the Playstation 3 in Fedora 12 (OtherOS) and it actually runs surprisingly well. The Cell System Simulator provides detailed low-level statistics on exactly how your Cell applications execute on the hardware and it is especially useful for tuning your code for optimal performance on the Cell Broadband Engine platform.
