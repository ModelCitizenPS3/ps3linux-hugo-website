## ps3linux-hugo-website

My current website, [PS3LINUX.NET](http://www.ps3linux.net), is very crappy. This is something that I know.

This repo contains the directory tree for what will become my new website, developed with the help of an open source project called HUGO, which is a *static site generator*.

This site is hosted on my web server and currently resides in a temporary "development" directory located here: [www.ps3linux.net/devel](http://www.ps3linux.net/devel).

Feel free to check up on my progress. Hopefully I will have to new site ready to publish and replace my crappy old site very soon.
